Where's My Lane supports iOS and Android 2.1 (or higher) exclusively.

Where's My Lane is an iPhone/Android application developed by three students attending Brandeis University. It was designed to help the City of Boston collect data on the incidence of double parked cars. The city will use this data to decide how to deploy its resources to alleviate the issue in problem areas.

The application is written using a framework called Phonegap (http://phonegap.com/). Phonegap allows the author to write an application as they would a webpage, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The device renders the application in a WebView, as it would any other webpage. However, all of the assets are local, and the application is treated as if it were native by the device.
